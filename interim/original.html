<body> <h4 id="preface">PREFACE.</h4>
<p>The subject of this inquiry, tho’ of that importance as to demand the care and attention of the ablest writers, is perhaps the least understood of any branch of science. This being in a great measure owing to the present corrupt state of languages, and the wrong course and direction of lexicographers in the investigation of them, the Writer of this essay, therefore, without presuming to instruct his readers in any common track of literature, only submits to their perusal some discoveries, which perhaps may be of service towards the restoration of language and primitive knowledge, and excite the curiosity of those of greater learning and penetration, and engage them, if possible, in a research worthy of their contemplation, the restoration of the first universal language of mankind. For although the ground-work, which chiefly depends on the author’s own discoveries, may be sketched out by himself, without the parts and learning of an Aristotle, yet it must be confessed that the finishing strokes in any new abstruse branches of literature deserve a more masterly hand. However, since we are here indiscriminately permitted a decent exercise of our faculties upon the most serious subjects, it is to be hoped no unpardonable offence has been committed, in submitting the following sheets to the judgment and decision of men of candor and learning. If they should in any degree approve of the writer’s labours, he will then be justified this intrusion into the province of the literati, with all his defects and inaccuracies. But should the contrary happen after an impartial and candid examination, he must then acquiesce with the common fate of his fellow-labourers, and impute his errors or mistakes to the intensity of his zeal for the service of mankind, more particularly Britons of all denominations. But to be condemned unheard, in a country that boasts so much of its liberties, especially those of the press, must be without a precedent.</p>
<p>However customary it has been for writers to take notice of the performances of former authors upon the like subjects, in order to shew the necessity or utility of their own; yet, as no person ever treated this subject upon the present plan, and the author is not so vain as to imagine that any thing he could have advanced might have been sufficient  to attract those that have been long accustomed to the clod-cutting traces, and the voice of prejudice or mere sounds, and he presumes not to teach any particular language or doctrine, it shall be declined as useless in the present case; and we shall proceed here to what seems to be more proper and necessary for the illustration of the subject in hand, namely, to transcribe some notes taken in the course of these inquiries, introductory to a rational grammar. And first of the nature and state of man.</p>
<p>Man, in the sense of language, is to be considered as a compound of all beings, a microcosm in his form, and a general intelligent echo of the divine fiat by his speech; a vegetable, by his manner of growth and nourishment; an animal by his motion, respiration, and feeling; and a spiritual being from his thinking or intelligent faculties; his animal part being probably formed with the other animals, out of the dust of the earth, and his intelligence in its first state, that tree of life, breath, or superaddition breathed into his nostrils by the creator, by which he became a living soul. The essence of this celestial and terrestrial system or compound being will probably remain indefinable, until man shall recover his primitive existence, as the tree of life; tho’ the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the mean time furnish him with sufficient means for his happiness here, and existence hereafter as the tree of life; for his organs of sensation, in contact with external objects and impressions, form in the sensory the various modes of feeling, and those images are perceived by the will; which has not only a nilling power of permitting those images to remain without any additional light, as the mere images of sensation fit only for the government of animal bodies; but also of willing or presenting them to the reflecting faculty of the soul for the formation of sentimental ideas, to be registered in the memory, and employed by the mind in its intelligent, rational, wise and virtuous operations, for the illumination and conduct of a reasonable being, appointed by Providence lord of the creation.</p>
<p>The human will being the sole energy of all voluntary motions in man, and motions continuing in direct lines or courses, if not diverted therefrom, most probably would have continued its pure intuitive course and direction towards goodness, virtue, and true happiness, without the power of nilling or depravely contradicting its original nature, as the tree of life, had not the serpent interposed and put the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and <em>evil</em> in its way. And as man in his state of innocence, before his fall, must, as the tree or  breath of life, have been furnished with the knowledge of good, so it seems probable that Moses by the tree of knowledge of good and <em>evil</em>, meant the generative powers, or certain characters or letters representing them, engraved on the <em>bark</em> of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, furnishing the first pair, in their state of innocence, with two sorts of ideas or knowledge, and the means of gratifying their lust, as well as pride or curiosity of knowing good and evil, like their superiors; mankind before their fall being probably capable of seeing each others ideas, without the use of sounds; and of propagation after the manner of the second Adam.</p>
<p>Since those animals, which are endued with the organs of speech, are incapable of articulating any conceptions, it is reasonable to suppose that the animal part of man alone, without the assistance of the intelligent or rational, must be so likewise. It is therefore probable that the human will, agreeable to the notes or ideas impressed on the memory, plays upon the fibres, the simple tones of articulation; which in their passage, with respiration, thro’ the lungs, stomach, windpipe, larynx, and mouth, are by the glotis, tongue, lips, muscles, and other organical powers, which assume literal figures, modulated into articulate sounds, both simple and compound, agreeable to the nature of things and their ideas, as impressed in the human sensory. And as man is furnished with ideas chiefly by the means of speech, the tree of knowledge of good and evil seems to be no improper metaphor of the human voice or <em>person</em>, or the Dryades and Hamadryades, nor the tree of life, of man’s intuitive state of knowledge and virtue.</p>
<p>It is yet the general opinion that human speech derives its origin solely from the arbitrary composition or invention of man, without any connexion with nature or the intervention of Providence. However true such bold and presumptuous doctrines may be with respect to some of the corrupt compounded parts, which chiefly occasioned the great variety and confusion of languages, yet articulate sounds, the materials of speech, clearly appear to have been the gift of Providence, and always the same in all countries; as for instance, an Indian, as well as an European, in expressing the idea of length, will contract and lengthen the organs of articulation, so as to form an acute sound, and the shape of the letter i; and to express breadth they will alike extend them, like the letter o, to express a broad or grave sound; and so in other  cases, though they differ as to the manner of compounding those sounds; more especially on account of the great loss of primitives amongst the Indians. And it cannot be otherwise, since the scripture proves that Adam named things agreeable to their nature, under the inspection and direction of Providence.</p>
<p>Again, to suppose man of himself, without the intervention of Providence, capable of forming the materials of his own speech, must be as absurd as to imagine that he formed the materials of his own ideas or himself, since speech depends on the original frame of man, and the shape of his organs, and abstract and complex ideas on names, as the means of forming and registering them in the memory. Nor does it appear to be less so, to imagine dumb men, without inspiration, capable of fixing upon arbitrary signs of language, or advancing in knowledge, or at least, of forming so perfect a system, without being previously taught the use of letters and characters, the elements and principles of languages; more especially such of the sounds and figures, as were not to be met with in any other parts of nature, and the unintuitive, vicious, privative, and negative parts both of knowledge and language, which depend on the hieroglyfic, sacred, or <em>secret</em> characters. And, whatever may be the disguise of arbitrary or corrupt dialects, they will all appear upon due examination to derive their origin from the original tree of knowledge; and was it not for the difference of climates, constitutions, habits, manners, and other accidents, which demand the aid of grammar, it seems probable, since characters represent the figures of things, and letters, or natural articulate sounds subsist in the very frame of man, the very ideas causing vibrations in the speaker, are felt by the hearer, and the elements of speech are universally the same, that languages would naturally fall, or at least, like the English, incline to their primitive universal state, and the same combination and construction of particles into words and sentences, if the particles of all languages were precisely defined according to their primitive meaning; there being in man an innate potency of recurring to, as well as an impotency of erring or deviating from the original modes of speech, as well as perceptions, and of becoming virtuous and vicious by turns.</p>
<p>Languages, it is true, have been fluctuating, and in particular the English; which was originally the Celtic or Phrygian, brought by our ancestors, the Titans, in the first westward migration, from the lesser Asia, thro’ Greece and Italy  into ancient Celtica; and which on the arrival of the Romans in Italy partook of the Greek dialects, and furnished the Romans with a considerable part of the Latin tongue. Some of the Aborigines of Italy, Spain, and Gaul, having afterwards fled from the Roman yoke into Germany, without their priests and druids, who had before retired into Britain, their language as well as knowledge received an ebb, though no foreign admixture. But their priests and bards denominated in the writings of the British poets, the Luchlin colony, and in Germany and Italy, by the names of Longobards, and Lombards, <em>the great bard nation</em>, and speaking the British language in Germany, being drove by the Romans out of Britain, into Germany and Denmark, their language as well as knowledge received some increase from the mother tongue; which then in its turn began to sink in Britain. And thus all the dialects of ancient Celtica are but different dialects of the old Celtic language, which first made its way into Europe, and so they ought to be deemed by lexicographers in their definition of vocables. But of all those dialects, the English in respect to the copiousness, strength, and simplicity both of its vocables and construction, seems to be the best fund for an universal language of any upon earth.</p>
<p>It may not perhaps seem improper here to explain some other abstruse principles in physics and metaphysics, from the meaning of vocables, as they too seem to explain the principles of rational grammar. There are, it seems, in physics, discoverable by the signification of words, three universal principles or genusses of things, namely, space, matter, and motion; which, as to their essences, if essence, nature, and quality differ in ought but form, are indefinable. But with respect to their modes, properties, and forms, space is distance every way, whether with or without body; with it, it is extension or capacity; without it, a vacuum; quantity, mensuration, number, place or matter extended, a continent, an island, length, breadth, figure, thickness, an inch, a foot, a yard and such things being its modes. Matter, whatever its essence may be, is an indivisible impenetrable atom or corpuscule; of which two or more assembled or cohered, form a particle, and larger cohesions or combinations of those form sensible bodies, which are chiefly distinguishable in language by their forms; though they have such properties and modes, as length, breadth, and thickness, or extension, solidity, or an assemblage excluding all other bodies from its place,  divisibility or the separation of its quantity, mobility, passiveness, and figure, or that length and breadth without thickness, which present themselves to the eye. And as to the active qualities of matter, they seem to be all intentional, as fluidity, softness, rarity, heat, and other modes of motion; all the rest being passive, and arising merely from the different texture, disposition, and combination of bodies; or a privation of the former; as, firmness, hardness, density, coldness, dryness, and rest. Motion is the successive passage or change from once place or state to another. Of which there are three sorts expressible by language, viz. the energic, generative, and local; which with their various modes or actions are expressible by verbs.</p>
<p>The metaphysical part of man, which derives its origin from the Creator’s impression, or the essence of the thinking soul, altho’ it has no more consciousness or knowledge of its own essence, than those of other beings; nor perhaps the means of its present modes of conception, without the use of those bodily organs, to which the all-wise Creator was pleased to confine it for a time, and the presence of internal objects, any more than the organs of sensation feel the touch without the contact of external objects, is still in the fool, as well as philosopher, when furnished with proper organs, equally capable of that innate potency of expressing its own qualities and actions, as is evident from our universal acknowledgement of a creator, and the different powers of those fools who are capable of lucid intervals. And however different our reasonings may be concerning the attributes of the infinite Creator, from the variousness of objects and different degrees of volition, there can be nothing more absurd than to affirm that the human soul cannot be impressed with the image of its Creator, because at times it expresses or affects no consciousness of it; consciousness being rather an energic affirmation or quality of the soul, than its essence, as an involuntary animal or vegetable motion is an act, rather than the cause of motion. Such perceptions however as it does express of spiritual beings, have privative, energic, or moral names; which are formed by the symmetry, and just measures and proportions of parts and modes of motion; from whence moral notions also derive their origin, as shall be shewn in the course of the following work, as shall also as to our mistaking infinite duration for time.</p>
<p>Tho’ metaphysics aid the moral plan,</p>
<p>“The proper study of mankind is man;”</p>
<p>His language part we now presume to scan,</p>
<p>A mighty maze to be without a plan;</p>
<p>‘A <em>wild</em> where weeds promiscuous shoot,</p>
<p>Or garden tempting with forbidden fruit;’</p>
<p>The tree of life, once, branches, stem, and root,</p>
<p>Of knowledge too, since <em>vices</em> on it shoot.</p>
<p>The garden cleared of the tares and weeds,</p>
<p>Gives willing force, and cogitation speeds.</p>
<p>‘Then, as life can little more supply,</p>
<p>Than just to look about us, and to die;</p>
<p>Expatiate free o’er all this scene of man,</p>
<p>A mighty maze! yet not without a plan.’</p>
<p>Plain truth, not <em>person</em>, is my utmost hope,</p>
<p>I tell you truly in the sense of Pope.</p>
<p><em>Wild</em> signifies a wood, or the place of the higher growth, and is an emblematical expression for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the Υλη, matter or sound of human speech, as ειδος seems to be of its ideal property.</p>
<p><em>Person</em> is a compound of pêr-son, <em>sweet sound</em>; pêr also signifies any sweet ripe fruit, as figs or figes, according to the Welsh; which perhaps resembles that which gave man the denomination of person, <em>the sound of the apple or afal</em>, and to the <em>fallen</em> angel that tempted Eve, the name of di-afal or devil, <em>the apple God</em>; and figes and vices signify the same thing; the v consonant and digamma being the same, and g being an inflection of the radical c. See <em>person</em>, <em>wood</em>, &amp;c. in the vocabulary.</p>
<p>The fall of man has laid us under a sort of charm, which nothing can remove but a thorough taste of the tree of knowledge, and avoiding its vicious branches as much as possible. Had that great reasoner Mr. Lock been so happy as to attend a little more to the tree of knowledge, instead of intirely rejecting the divine origin of human speech, and innate principles of thinking, he might have reasoned well upon <em>right</em> principles, instead of misleading and confirming us in our errors, as without doubt was his intention.</p>
<p>The learned Hermes, the very best of modern grammarians, whose ingenious performance, had it sooner come to my perusal, might have charmed me out of my present labours, to acquiesce with his opinions, seems to be a little affected by this fort of charm, and perhaps is as much deluded from his subject by the language, learning, and beauties of the Greeks and Romans, as the late author of the short introduction to the English language, by some of our modern barbarisms, the very exceptionable parts of our language.</p>

<h4 id="grammar">GRAMMAR.</h4>
<p>Grammar is the right method of expressing the ideas of things by signs and sounds adapted for the sensation of the eye and ear, according to their hieroglyfic nature, forms, and modes, and that εντελεχεια or intelligent echo, with which man was originally endued by his Creator.</p>
<p>It consists of three parts or sorts of names, viz. letters, considered as characters or the figures of things, and as signs of articulate sounds; their combination into particles and nouns; and their construction into phrases, propositions, and sentences. And, according to the present state of languages, etymology may be admitted as a fourth division of grammar.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="letters">LETTERS.</h3>
<p>Letters, as γραμματα or characters, either really or emblematically personate, and represent things and ideas; and as notes of articulate sounds signify internal conceptions, and express them to others. They consist of various sorts, such as simple characters to denote elements or principles; compounds to express complex ideas, and things; the dividers of parts; actives, energies, and affirmatives; and privatives, and negatives. These are the smallest or elementary parts of language, as atoms are of matter and action of motion; an assemblage thereof form particles, as of atoms do those of matter; and a combination of either form more sensible bodies, and so on to the construction of larger forms, masses or sentences; letters having been formed in their shapes and sounds, agreeable to ideas and things, and having a natural connection therewith; and length and breadth affecting the eye in the same manner as their vibrations do the ear, and a combination of both the human will and perception.</p>
<p>Characters, which consist of irregular lines, circles, or curves, are incapable of general signs or meanings, or representing  many things; but strait lines, and circles, and their division and multiplication, like the Roman, only are capable of that hieroglyfic, universal representation and meaning, which the first universal language must be supposed to express, and as most other characters seem to be only deviations from the Roman, from mere affectation, or for the conveniency of sculpture, there seems to be no great absurdity in supposing that Adam was furnished with <em>those</em> characters, and instructed in their sounds; that they continued in general use until the confusion of Babel, when mankind began to make use of the noise or sounds of cattle instead of human voices; and that the Romans were furnished with those characters by the Tuscans on their arrival in Italy. Nor does it seem in the least probable that those nations which had been destined by Providence to be the possessors of the most distant countries westward from Asia, who made their way thither accordingly, along the Mediterranean coasts, through Crete, Greece, Sicily, Egypt, Mauritania, Tuscany, Spain, Gaul, and Britain, were in Asia at the time of the confusion. And as those characters are adapted only for the Celtic, Phrygian, or British language, which resolves the names of places of the several countries through which it passed, preferable to the more modern dialects thereof, and Cæsar thought that Druidism began in Britain; it seems very probable that Mercury, Gomer, or Hermes, and other Druids, leaders of the western colonies, were always possest of those <em>secret</em> characters; it being certain that the Gauls before Cæsar’s time had the use of letters. Besides, ancient history takes notice of the hieroglyfics, as consisting of the figures of animals, parts of human bodies, and mechanical instruments invented by Thoth the first Hermes, which were afterwards translated into Greek, and deposited in books in the Egyptian temples, and which the learned supposed to be sacred characters.</p>
<p>The characters of the first language were without doubt simple, requiring but few rules for their combination and construction; and yet must have been expressive of all the natural signs and sounds of things; for such certainly ought to be the construction of a language proposed for an universal assent; and such in my opinion is the English, whose vocables are hieroglyfic; and their meaning agreeing with the picturesque combination. These were the ancient characters, engravings, or γραμματα; and their sounds were the στοιχα, <em>the chief sounds</em>; and which we shall here proceed to explain, together with the Greek characters.</p>

<p><img src="images/letter-table.jpg" alt="here"></p>
<p>This table is included as some of the characters in it may have more than one interpretation.</p>
<p>This alphabet consists of seven vowels or voices, which in their own nature, actively, and without any super-addition, yield compleat articulate sounds, particles, or names, and hieroglyfically represent the elementary or active parts of the human body, and nature, as similar thereto, namely, a, e or h, i, o, u, w or ω, Υ; and of other characters or letters, which are called consonants from their yielding articulate sounds only in company with vowels. Of these b, c, d, f, g, l, m, p, t, are also hieroglyfic representations of the various parts of the human body and other things as similar thereto; and they are mutable and inflectory in the pronominal cases, from the less animate, slow, and almost silent radical state, both as to the sense and sound, to the rougher, louder, and more animate and active sounds and things; as for instance, c, p, τ, the most silent, as expressive of material or passive substances or local inanimate actions inflect into g, b, d, which are somewhat louder and rougher, as being expressive of the higher and more active things and actions of men and animals; and those again into the still louder and rougher sounds of ch, ff, th, as those are expressive of the most energic actions or modes of motion; but when g, b, d, are the radicals of inflection, they again inflect into ng, f, m, dd, n, and in some dialects the l and r have the aspirates ll and rh for the radicals, as has been shewn in my former treatises. To the loss of these inflections may in a great measure be imputed the great variety and confusion of languages; new dialects having been formed by changing the radicals and misapplying the inflectories, as father for pater, brother for frater, and mother for mater. b, c, d, j, k, p, q, t, as yielding little or no sounds, without the assistance of vowels, are called mutes; l, m, n, r, f, s, as having imperfect obscure sounds without the company of vowels, have been distinguished as semivowels; and l, m, n, r, also as liquids from their flowing in particles, as in, îf, îl, îm, în, îr, the flow of the sun’s rays, light, motion, liquid, and life or qualities upon the lower world of beings and things; but the distinctions of mutes and semivowels seem trifling, as most letters seem to be vowels in some degree.</p>
<p>Here, before we proceed to explain the figures and powers of letters, it may not perhaps be improper to observe that the parts, affections, and ideas of the human pair, incorporated, as in the figures at the end of this essay, were the archetypes or patterns of the original characters, whose figures and sounds are descriptive of the universe; that letters and particles have two sounds, the masculine and feminine,  the active and passive, or the short and long; that a particle or syllable cannot in the genuine sense of language consist of more than two letters; and that there are not in fact any such things as dipthongs; those now supposed to be such, being two or three particles of one vowel each, which formerly was a common method of composition, as appears by the following piece of ancient poetry; in which there is no consonant made use of, the r being only a letter of sound.</p>
<p>Oer iu yr eira ar yr yri,</p>
<p>Oi riu or awyr i rewi;</p>
<p>Oer iu yr ia oi riu ri</p>
<p>Ar eira oer iu yr yri.</p>
<p>Thus Englished.</p>
<p>From its high hill cold is ice,</p>
<p>Cold is the snow on Snowden;</p>
<p>Its nature from the sky to freeze</p>
<p>On snow so cold is Snowden.</p>
<p>The letter o is an indefinite circle, signifying the universe, motion, space, the sun’s figure and motion, and all or ol, extension of length, breadth, and thickness; and it is expressible of parts only by a diminution of its general sense; as in b-ol, a ball or part of all, or-b, a circle part, w-or-l-d, a man’s circle part or place of life, b-or-d-er the circle part of the possessions and 10, one circle, which being repeated comprehends all numbers. This, like all other original letters, has two sounds, the long and the short, as in <em>on</em>, <em>one</em>, <em>ton</em>, <em>tone</em>; and its shape or figure was taken from the circumference of the human pair close together, face to face, which is man’s chief circle place, signified by the term <em>world</em>. The Greek ω is a double υ as has been explained in my former treatise.</p>
<p>The letter i is an indefinite line, representing man in his primitive state of innocence, as it does still his body, as a line, without its extension, and his head and senses by its dot; and in a secondary sense are expressed by this line and dot, length or heighth towards the sun, the sun-beams, fire, heat, and other qualities both spiritual and animal, as still flowing upon man, and other things as relative to him, and originally perhaps centering in himself, and since his fall only relatively. But though man and nature have been impaired  by original sin, they still seem to be invested with certain springs, energies, or returns of those ilations and qualities, as, thinking, willing, voice articulate, powers generative and growth; whereby the human species may be extended, and acquire so much knowledge and virtue, as, with the blessing of Providence, to be capable of being reinstated. The chief of which springs is expressed by the letter u, a compound of two i’s signifying man’s compound of male and female, and spirit and matter, with a c at their bottom, springing them upwards; by y as to the generative and vegetative parts, which also is expressive of woods and other growth; it being a compound of i j, and half of the spring c, as not being expressive of the spirit of man. The i also expresses man as an upright line placed in the centre of all worldly beings and substances, to whom they bear a relation, as shall be shewn under adverbs. The u vowel seems to derive its figure from the human face, the seat of the voice, and the heart, and the feminine or consonant v from the vagina, if it be an original letter, but, from its sound, it seems to supply the place of the digamma. The y or Υ resembles trees, plants and vegetables, and the j consonant is the half of it, and sometimes made use of instead of g, to express some of the generative parts and qualities. These vowels have each two sounds, the high and low, long and short, or grave and acute, viz. i, as in, <em>in</em>, <em>high</em>, or <em>i</em>, go thou; the u vowel, as, in, <em>unction</em>, <em>united</em>; and the y as the u in unction and y in hyssop; but the w has only one long sound, as in <em>woman</em>, <em>womb</em>, <em>wood</em>, and it is mostly applicable to spirituals, man, and things belonging to him; the wh has the gutteral sound of the Welsh ch, or the Greek χ as in <em>where</em>, <em>why</em>; the j consonant has the sound of g in <em>generation</em>; and the v consonant that of the soft flowing f of the Welsh, or as in <em>verb</em>, <em>vice</em>; thus supplying the softer sound and meaning of the digamma.</p>
<p>The letters a, e, h, ε, η, Η, in their primary sense signify the male and female posteriors, the clitoris, erectores, &amp;c. the impulse and springs of generation, and the earth and water place of man; whence a came to be an expression for the element earth or matter and things hard, rough, or interjectory, and ε for the element of water and any feminine, soft, or passive parts or things, but the interjectory aspirate e or <em>he</em> is masculine, and the ε has one spring resembling that of rain. The a has properly two sounds, as in <em>animal</em>, <em>have</em>, or <em>name</em>, but not that of o or the northern a in <em>all</em>; the masculine e or he has an aspirate sound, as in <em>hero</em>, and a mute  one, as in <em>echo</em>; and the feminine ε was originally sounded soft, like the French cedill ç, as in <em>fleece</em>, <em>vice</em>, and the use of this character and sound ought to be continued or the soft c should be marked with a cedill to prevent the confusion of the hard and soft sounds of c; but more of this elsewhere.</p>
<p>The letters c, k, q, g, γ, wh, ch, κ, χ, Ξ, ξ signify actions of different sorts and degrees, viz. c as the half of o, signifying motion, and k and q, as significant of its sound, signify the modes of common local motions or actions; and the hard c also represents half the round of the posteriors, as o doth the whole of the male and female together, as the feminine or soft c doth the other half; g or γ represent the testicles or half the gamma, f being the other half, and the generative and growing parts of man and nature; and the rest are their gutteral inflections expressive of animal sounds and actions. The palatals should be sounded hard and short, as in <em>quick</em>, the soft c in some cases as the feminine ε before explained, and s before the vowel i, the superlative gutteral sorts, as the wh in <em>where</em>, <em>why</em>, and the Welsh <em>chwa</em>, <em>chwant</em>, and g or γ as in <em>egg</em>, <em>edge</em>. All these characters are nothing more than compounds of c, h, s, as will be shewn hereafter.</p>
<p>The letters d and b put together, thus, db, as compounds of i and o, or length and breadth, are expressive of man and woman’s body part, from the thigh to the part of the body which the elbow reaches, and all other living beings so extended, as τ does the extension of matter, but being again divided into d and b, they express living things, or the qualities of parts and diminutives of bodies, and emblematically spirits and privatives, as p does parts of matter, as divisor of τ. The d and b ought to be sounded alike in all languages, as, <em>de</em>, <em>be</em>, and dd, as <em>the</em>, but letters are farther explained in the former treatise.</p>
<p>T represents man’s legs together, with the feet upwards, and both toes turned outwards as upright and traverse lines, extension and man in his temporal state, turned out of paradise, under the sky, topsy turvy, and all things as relative to him, and the line upon which time or the manner of reckoning the distances of actions are measured. T sounds alike in all languages, and th and θ as in <em>the</em>, <em>Thebes</em>, and those are the inflections of T.</p>
<p>The letters p, ph, ff, f, π, φ, ψ, signify material or dead parts, or their qualities, as p divides T; ph is p high, up, or active; the digamma φ or f, the p inflecting the gamma; and ψ actions of a lesser nature, as growth.  The p and π sound alike in all languages, ph, ff as φυω, <em>fusee</em>, or <em>fun</em>, ψ as in <em>Psalms</em>, it being only a compound of p, and f as the v consonant in <em>verb</em>, but these letters are farther explained in the former treatise.</p>
<p><em>m</em> represents a man’s body and arms or wings from the top of b and d, or the elbow part of the body, up to the neck, and the world, forms, and things, as surrounding and belonging to man, as shall be further explained amongst the particles. It sounds the same in all languages. <em>n</em> is the thighs, with the parts above them, forming a traverse line, and the vacancy betwixt the same when extended, signifying to be in, or in existence or possession, having f and d for its auxiliaries, but before the vowels or springs it expresses a negative or privative; and it has no particular sound.</p>
<p>Ỻ, L, λ, are T or man’s legs, once put together, separated, and as divisors of T, which signifies space or extension, are expressive of particular lengths and breadths, and their places, qualities, &amp;c. The L or λ is sounded as eel or îl and Ỻ has an aspirate hissing sound in the Welsh, Spanish, and some other dialects.</p>
<p>The letters r, ϱ, ρ, Ρ, R, represent animals and their parts, and their mouths as the place of sound; S being added to P, as a sound, forms R, the sound as well as part of an animal; and they are all to be sounded as in <em>viper</em>, except where they happen to be radical letters, and then with an aspirate h as in <em>rhyme</em>. The S, σ, Z, are also letters of sound, but express no part of man, and are rather the shape of some animal of the serpentine kind, the waving of the breath or water, &amp;c. They have two sounds, the hard and soft, as in <em>loss</em>, <em>zone</em>. This explanation of letters, together with what has been given already in my former treatises, and shall be added amongst the particles, will, it is to be hoped, be deemed satisfactory, as to the sense and origin of letters, and the sacred characters; notwithstanding the pretensions lately set up for those of irregular lines, curves, and windings, which can express but few things, and the remarks of another ingenious gentleman, as to the non-entity or insignificancy of the Hieroglyfics; his enquiry having been confined to the vulgar sorts, or the paintings or engravings of animals, &amp;c. when it now appears the Hieroglyfics consisted only of those few sacred or <em>secret</em> characters. The hints and specimens here given of the method of combining the hieroglyfic figures, being as compleat as the press will admit of; and a process thereof, thro’ the whole of the English language, considering the corrupt state of languages, tho’ the English is as capable  of an hieroglyfic combination as any, requiring much loss of time, trouble, and expence, and perhaps the aid of a Hunter and a Hill, and some other reasons occurring, the author hopes he shall be excused for proceeding no further at the present, in the combination of characters.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="of-particles-and-syllables">Of Particles and Syllables.</h3>
<p>A Particle is a simple articulate sound and sign of one or two characters or letters; but a syllable sometimes by the cutting off of vowels, becomes a combination of more letters, which is yet commonly pronounced as a simple articulate sound; there being a natural relation and agreement betwixt the signs and sounds of letters, and ideas and things. Particles and syllables were originally framed according to their hieroglyfic shape, the natural sounds of ideas and things, and the sense and value of letters, as has been already explained; and therein the quantity of the action of sound was measured and proportioned to the motion, action, or energy of the thing to be expressed, as the high, loud, acute, or short accent, for an active or energic particle, and the low, grave, and long, for a passive, substantive, or a negative one.</p>
<p>And altho’ some letters, as a, e, y, p, t, and some particles in words are so fixed by the addition of y, ty, ive, and other terminations, as of themselves to be always substantive and long, as to quantity and accent; yet those passive and long letters and particles, by the addition of an active vowel, consonant, or particle, will become active and short. Hence the best way of spelling or pronouncing must be to divide the particles of compound names according to the original manner of their combination, sense, and sounds, and when a vowel is cut off, its consonant, with the remaining vowel, or with the most valuable, if there should be any doubt, as in the following examples, ex-ec-ra-ble, co-re-spond-ing, pro-ble-m-at-ic-al-ly, un-ec-spect-ed-ly, prin-ce, o-af, o-ther, o-ver,  ub-iqu-i-ty. Those sorts of names and their compounds according to their significations and nature in language, are distinguishable into the following sorts, viz. Articles to substantive and identify names; nouns substantive, or the names of substances; pronouns, which collectively express nouns and antecedent parts of sentences; adjectives, which are added to the names of substances, to express their qualities and accidents; actives, or the names of actions, verbs, energies, and affirmatives of being, acting, and feeling; adverbs or additional words, to express quantities, qualities, distances, modes, and energies of actions and things, with their degrees; prepositions to denote and connect situations, and conjunctions or connectives of names, proportions, and sentences.</p>
<p>As the right apprehension of the hieroglyfic primitive language very much depends on a clear illustration of particles, which as sorts of compound letters, together with the primitive hieroglyfic letters, comprehend all the materials of the first universal language, the following addition is here made to what has been already published on the etymology of particles; the radicals being placed in each class before their inflections and transponents. Ab, eb, af, ef; ba, be, fa, fe.

See the Postscript.</p>
<p>Ar, er, ra, re, signify earth and water or matter, as in ar-able, ac-ar, bran-ar, fallow-land, e-ar-th, or the elements of both earth and water, ab-er, running water or harbour, go-er, a rivulet or shore, ra-bet, ra-ble, er-uption, re-turn, re-flow, re-nt.</p>

<p>Of those sorts of names are formed the more complex, such as those names, phrases, or propositions called words merely by a combination of the proper sorts, either with or without an elision of consonants. In the latter case, the less expressive, valuable, or necessary may be cut off when two vowels occur in composition, as its consonant will in some measure preserve its sound in company with a more worthy vowel; and all active radical vowels ought to be dropped in the names of substances and things, as appears by the following examples, viz. blackish or b-li-ack-ish, <em>a thing without light</em>; blessedness or bi-il-ess-ed-in-ess, <em>life flowing down upon the world</em>; brutish, or ab-ru-ti-ish, <em>he is from the property of truth</em>; clamorous or ac-al-am-or-us, <em>a great calling action about us</em>; cliverly, or ci-liv-erly, <em>like the water clan</em>; creating or ac-ci-ir-at-ing, <em>the chief or first motion to extension and action</em>; crocodile or ac-ir-oc-o-di-il, <em>an angry acting, deceitful water animal</em>; dread or id-ir-ad, <em>at the fire</em>; flow or af-il-ow, <em>a spring of the rays of the sun</em>; frost or af-oer-st, <em>the lower parts at a stand from the cold</em>; and cold is from ac-ol-id <em>to be without sun</em>; glorifying or ag-lo-ri-fying, <em>the doing of an high action in an extensive place</em>; gnaw or ag-in-w, <em>the acting in of an animal</em>; grass or ag-ar-as, <em>the action upon the ground</em>; place or p-la-ce, <em>a part of the earth’s</em> extension; property or pe-or-pe-er-ty, <em>entity or possession of  the parts of land and water or of this globe</em>; scull or si-cau-al, <em>the sight shut</em>; sky or is-kay, <em>the covering of below</em>; slack or is-al-ack, <em>a low or slow action</em>; small or is-am-il, <em>the rays of the sun about below</em>; snail or si-in-na-il, <em>it is in without light</em>; speak or si-pe-ak, <em>the action of the sound part</em>; spy or si-pe-y, <em>the seeing thing</em>; star or sta-ir, <em>the standing fires</em>; trace or tir-race, <em>the land race</em>; and race or ir-ace, is a <em>long action</em>.</p>

<h3 id="article">ARTICLE.</h3>
<p>The article, αρθρα, partakes of the nature of pronouns; and in apposition or concord with another name, either active or substantive, determines it to be a substantive, or the name of a substance, with its identity and number.</p>
<p>There are two sorts of articles, viz. <em>the</em> and <em>an</em>; an becomes <em>a</em> or <em>any</em> before a consonant, and either of them being placed in apposition to an active convertible name, convert it into a substantive, as <em>to form</em> into <em>a form</em>, <em>to chase</em> into <em>a chase</em>. And, names being first formed in the plural number, both these then stood as signs of the singular number; but since plural names have been taken as singular, and new signs have been added thereto to form plurals, <em>the</em> is also put in apposition to plural names, to indentify the person or thing meant or spoken of.</p>
<p>Example; Some may still imagine <em>the</em> signification of <em>an</em> article or <em>a</em> letter, and perhaps more compound names to be indefinable, and the article to be useless; tho’ <em>the</em> definitions here given thereof evidently shew <em>the</em> contrary; and the Greeks and Romans not only made use of the genders ο, η, το, and hic, hæc, hoc, but also of a declining article at the end of nouns, as the Welsh did <em>un</em> and <em>yr</em>, which last before a consonant sunk into y <em>the</em>, inflecting with the following radical consonant; and other nations have made use of the article. <em>To</em> dispute the utility of the article seems therefore absurd, but it may be <em>a</em> dispute, whether either determine <em>any</em> particular individual, or only some third person alluded to,  pointed at, meant or spoken of in discourse, or in the line of possession; ο, η, το, hic, hæc, hoc, this, that, yr, un, le, ein and der expressing as much.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="of-nouns-substantive">Of Nouns Substantive.</h3>
<p>A Noun Substantive denotes a substance, as a spirit, an animal, a vegetable, or any other thing that may be conceived to subsist, as <em>agreeableness</em>, <em>agility</em>, <em>acceleration</em>; which, tho’ their qualities, <em>agreeable</em>, <em>agile</em>, <em>accelerate</em>, are indefinite or indeterminate, yet by the signs, <em>ness</em>, <em>ty</em>, <em>ion</em>, signifying substances, properties, and the sun’s motion, acquire such a determinate meaning as to become substantives, and to shew their meaning without being joined with any other word. And all names, whether of substances, qualities, or other things, to which the articles <em>an</em> or <em>the</em>, or any other substantive signs are joined or set in apposition, are nouns substantive.</p>
<p>There are in the English language more substantive names than seem to be necessary for an universal language, besides the synonymas of various other dialects, which are incongruous in sense, with the hieroglyfic signs, and tend to darken and confound the natural sense and sounds of names and things. Tho’ the English vocables are explained elsewhere, we shall here take notice of some peculiarities of that nature in the English substantives.</p>
<p>Bl-ab, b-abe; ebb, gl-ebe; rib, tr-ibe; kn-ob, gl-obe; t-ub, t-ube; where the final <em>e</em> should be dropped, and the remaining vowel marked with a grave accent, as tub, tùb.</p>
<p>B-ack, b-ake; b-eck, b-eke; l-ick, like, link; p-ock, p-oke, m-uck, p-uke. These might be wrote as lic, lìc.</p>
<p>Ax, sex, ra-dix, ox, ux, as acs or ach as formerly. Ach, be-ach, spe-ech, st-ich, l-och, n-och, touch.</p>
<p>M-atch, l-etch, itch, b-otch, sm-utch.</p>
<p>H-ac, ar-se, ace, dice, d-oce, d-uce.</p>
<p>H-ag, l-eg, g-ig, l-og, h-ug.</p>
<p>Age, b-adge, coll-ege, edge, se-ige, br-idge, d-oge, l-odge, subterf-uge, b-udge.</p>
<p>Aight, eight, f-ight, f-ought, o-ught. These eight last classes are made use of to express the three subsisting sorts of actions, viz. the local or inanimate, the generative and energic, when the first might be expressed by c, the second by  g, and the third by ch, as, ac, àc, and aç with a cedille, that is, the acute, the grave, and soft or feminine; ag, àg, āg for the short, long, and soft of the generative species of motion; and ach, àch, and āch, the last to be sounded like the Welsh ch or the English <em>wh</em> in what or where, for the acute, grave, and gutteral of energies and animal motions; so that these three letters, which the Welsh inflect so as to express the cases and genders by the difference of acute, grave, and gutteral, might very well serve for all the uses of the eight last classes of names, should the whole be deemed necessary. But, those of the third, fifth, eighth, and ninth classes are compound sounds expressed by a combination of characters, which ought not to be kept together but in terminations; they having been corruptly introduced into languages by the Greeks and Romans, in order to express qualities and pleasant sounds contrary to the nature of things.</p>
<p>Bre-ad, bl-ade, br-ed, br-eed, ma-id, si-de, c-od, c-ode, b-ud, pr-ude, should be wrote and accented as ud, ùd.</p>
<p>St-af, st-ave, be-ef, be-eve, l-ife, ol-ive, beho-of, beho-ove, c-ave, might be made staff and stàf, as formerly.</p>
<p>An-im-al, male, h-ell, h-eel, circ-le, Apr-il, v-ill, b-ile, car-ol, par-ole, c-ull, b-ull, m-ule, might be wrote and accented al, àl, el, èl, il, ìl, not eel, ol, òl, ul, ùl; or as the Welsh and Spanish aspirate ll.</p>
<p>H-am, l-ame, sarc-asm, anth-em, th-eme, apoth-egm, cla-im, cl-ime, quiet-ism, wisd-om, h-ome, mikrocosm, ch-um, h-ume, usm. Here the final e might be dropped, and the Greek compounds have no particular meaning; all being alike expressive of the forms of substances and things.</p>
<p>Me-an, m-ane, g-ang, p-en, obsc-ene, chall-enge, p-in, p-ine, th-ing, mo-ti-on, t-ong, b-un, b-ung. These signify various existences and things, and are properly accented; but the final e might be exchanged in writing, for the grave accent, màn.</p>
<p>Attend-ance, abstin-ence, prov-ince, sc-once, d-unce. These may do as to orthography and accent, and signify the ens or essence of various things, as, ance of earthly substances, ens those of water, ince of things in general, once of motion, and unce of man, as in dunce or di-unce a privative of the human essence.</p>
<p>Ant, ag-ent, m-int, f-ont, h-unt, signify the possession of the earth and water or property, properties in  general, the property of motion and human property, that is of hunting or driving to and fro in the possessions.</p>
<p>G-ap, g-ape, sle-ep, p-eep, tr-ip, tr-ipe, h-op, h-ope, s-up, d-upe, shap, ship, shop. Here the grave accent might serve for the final e; the meaning thereof being the division generally of matter into substances or parts, except the terminations shap, ship, and shop, signifying from high or high.</p>
<p>Cell-ar, c-are, be-er, p-er, or pear, f-ir, fire, clam-or, st-ore, c-ur, cens-ure, am-our or am-ur, here the final e might be dropped; and ar signifies upon, àr earth, er since, èr water, ir high or to, ìr fire, or from, òr an extension of possession, or a circle, ur or wr a man.</p>
<p>Lam-as, ass, g-aze, ash, be-ast, actr-ess, sque-ese, fl-esh, ap-ish-ness, apt-ness, ch-est, bl-iss, s-ize, f-ish, l-ist, m-oss, d-oze, osh, c-ost, b-uss, f-uze, bush, b-ust, might be all expressed and accented as, as, às, ash, ast to express the affirmations and energies of affections, properties, and things.</p>
<p>P-at, p-ate, p-et, def-ete, b-it, b-ite, kn-ot, m-ote, c-ut, mute, p-ath, t-eeth, fa-ith, m-oth, mo-uth. These express the identity and property of different parts or things, and the final e might be exchanged for the grave accent.</p>
<p>Abili-ty, agili-ty, ami-ty, du-ty, antipa-thy, apa-thy, sympa-thy. These signify different general properties and qualities of things.</p>
<p>Aristocra-cy, oligar-chy, ordina-ry, mason-ry, orator-y, lecher-y, grocer-y, orthodox-y, ha-y, ho-y. The cy and chy signify different qualities, and the y is the Welsh <em>the</em>.</p>
<p>Ma-w, me-w, mo-w, and s or es for substantives of a plural nature. This w signifies different springs.</p>
<p>Substantives are distinguished by grammarians into appellatives or general names of things common to many individuals, as <em>man</em>, <em>river</em>, <em>month</em>, <em>wind</em>; and proper names, appropriated only to individuals, as, <em>George</em>, <em>Britain</em>, <em>London</em>, <em>October</em>, <em>Libs</em>, which admit of neither articles or plurality of numbers. But all words, excepting one or an, according to their natural meaning seem to me to be appellative and capable of being applied to things of a plural nature, were their primitive sense understood, as for instance, <em>George</em>, which originally signified <em>a chief of the circle nation</em>, as an appellative name of a magistrate, in the same manner as King, Prince, Duke, or any other; but when its original meaning was lost, and it came to be adopted as a Christian name by  different families, it was thence supposed to be a mere arbitrary term, imposed as the name of an individual; and so as to Britain, London, October, Libs, Thames, Avon, which were originally appellatives or common expressions for <em>the sea coast</em>, <em>long towns</em>, <em>the eighth month from the spring</em>, <em>the west south-west, or Libian wind</em>, <em>the limits of the Iceni</em>, and <em>Rivers</em>. So that these names, so long as their original meanings were understood, were as much appellative or common expressions, as man, river, month, wind, or any other common names, and as capable too of a plural or singular sense, in concord with the articles or demonstrative pronouns; as, <em>a</em>, <em>the</em>, <em>this</em>, or <em>that</em>, chief of the circle nation or long town, &amp;c. Hence the distinction of common and proper names seems to be frivolous and unnecessary.</p>
<p>All substantives were originally appellative and plural, and the articles and demonstrative pronouns were set in apposition or as terminations thereto, to determine their singular nature as well as the identity of the individual. But as they are now mostly understood as the signs of single things, the English method of adding s or es as a plural termination, should be generally followed as the best method; unless substantives and their articles should be restored to their original sense and use; but in either case the particles, an or en, as terminations of plural names, when the sense will admit of their being singular, and en does not express the male and female of the same kind, as men does both man and woman, seem to be improper. Nor is it best so to continue the use of such plurals, as mice, lice, teeth, feet, geese, but rather mus, lus, toth, fot, gus, which are so in their nature, as expressing the little eaters, the little family, the grinders, the movers and the water nation. It is however certain that the numbers of nouns are in their nature but two, singular and plural, one and two or many, but whether they are expressed by one or an, and two or as and es seems not to be very material, tho’ as and es were the primitive signs, as, <em>as</em> signified the masculine gender, and <em>es</em> the feminine. And numbers and genders ought to be the same.</p>
<p>There were originally no other distinction of genders of nouns than the masculine and feminine, and which were distinguishable only by the signification of vocables; and whatever other arbitrary modes and distinctions as to genders of nouns and their declensions or inflections have been arbitrarily made by other nations, the English still in fact adhere to the original masculine and feminine genders, the only distinction of nature, <em>as</em> and <em>es</em>; for were the meaning of substantives  precisely understood, they would all appear to be either masculine or feminine, at least, as relative to man and woman, or according to their active and passive, or hard and soft sounds. Nor do the English adjectives or pronouns vary as to genders, numbers, or cases, as has been supposed; but naturally agree in concord, without any variation or inflection thereof, from their primitive state.</p>
<p>Indeed if the Welsh modes of inflection derive their origin from the original language, which was musical, and vocables could be reduced to their true primitive state, perhaps it might be the best way, but as that might be impracticable or too arduous a task, we may as well stick to our old English voices, which deviate so very little from the primitive language.</p>
<p>And, as to any variation of cases or the declension of nouns, the English still remains in the primitive state of language without any; their prepositions being fully expressive of the situation and direction of actions and things, and those of other nations being altogether arbitrary and calculated more for the sake of variety and preservation of vocables, than from any necessity, as their prepositions and vocables might in their primitive state be as expressive, and agree in concord, like the English, which has no other state or case, than that in which names were originally formed, or the nominative, as will appear to any one, that will be at the trouble of a deliberate consideration of the origin, frame, and construction of the English language, whatever may have been advanced by our modern grammarians, as to the variation of the genitive or possessive case.</p>

<h3 id="of-pronouns-or-general-personates">Of Pronouns or general Personates.</h3>
<p>Pronouns, so called from their being supposed to be mere substitutes of nouns, ought according to their signification to be deemed either substantives or adjectives; for as general signs they serve to personate, demonstrate, relate, and interrogate persons, things, and parts of discourses; and being all demonstrative and interrogative, they are properly distinguishable only into the following sorts, viz.</p>
<p>Personals.</p>
<p>Possessives.</p>
<p>Relatives.</p>
<p>I, me, myself;</p>
<p>my - own, mine;</p>
<p>one, any, none.</p>
<p>Thou or you, thee, thyself;</p>
<p>thy - thine;</p>
<p>this, each, every, either.</p>
<p>He, she, it, him, her, himself, herself;</p>
<p>her, its - hers;</p>
<p>that, some, another, such.</p>
<p>We, us, ourselves;</p>
<p>our - ours;</p>
<p>who, whose, whom.</p>
<p>Ye or you, yourselves;</p>
<p>your - yours;</p>
<p>which.</p>
<p>They, them, themselves;</p>
<p>their - theirs;</p>
<p>what.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tho’ the English, Welsh, Greek, and Latin pronouns are, with the other parts of speech, all defined in the vocabulary at the end of this essay, it may not be improper here to observe in general, as to their signification, that the first personal pronoun substantively, and not substitutionally signifies man as an indefinite line placed alone or by himself in the centre of things before his extension or division into U the male and female spring; the 2d, the-o-U or y-o-U, the <em>off man</em> or woman; 3d, man extended into T, or in his race and possessions; and hi and shi, the male and female forms and existences; 4th, mankind; 5th, the first and second female persons; 6th, all mankind, persons, and things, except the first second and third persons singular. The possessives express all things to be <em>in man</em>, as one universal possessor; and to relate to his descendents as their qualities and properties. The relative and interrogative <em>which</em> is a compound of wch-ich signifying the above action, as <em>ich</em> means the first act of motion or creation, and uch man’s utmost return of that act or spring upwards. And so used as a general relative and interrogative of all actions, as <em>who</em> is of persons, and <em>what</em> of things, and as to the rest they are particularly explained in the vocabulary.</p>
<p>The personal pronouns and such of the possessives and relatives as will not join with substantives in construction, are substantives, and the rest are adjectives; and pronouns like other English nouns, have no variation or declension of person, number, gender, or case, but each is an original, distinct name. So that to attempt any further distinction of pronouns, like all other unnecessary distinctions, would tend to the confusion, rather than the illustration of language, and they perhaps might be better distinguished by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or their original signification of 1st, 2d, 3d, persons singular and plural; tho’ such names as have no foundation in nature, may require more arbitrary rules towards their explanation.</p>

<h3 id="of-nouns-adjective-and-participle">Of Nouns Adjective and Participle.</h3>
<p>Adjective and participle nouns are <em>added</em> to substantives and propositions, as expressive of the attributes or qualities, affections, and accidents of things, as in the following example; The <em>preying</em> beast was <em>daring</em>; the astonished guese are <em>fled</em>, <em>lost</em>, or <em>stolen</em>; and he is still <em>pursuing</em> a fled, lost, or stolen gus, in order to make a <em>sweet</em> morsel of its garbage; but all such sensations are <em>nauseous</em> to human nature. But qualities were originally expressed by the verbal actives, with few particles, and the compounded sorts were adjected thereto.</p>
<p>And qualities being the effects of light, heat, and motion, flowing upon, warming or penetrating bodies differently modified in various degrees, and the sensations thence produced in us, as those of colours, tastes, sounds and feeling, rather than any internal offences or properties of matter or substances, adjectives assert or express their subsistence as the attributes of various substances and things, as the following specimen of English adjectives shews.</p>
<p>There are no adjectives terminating in b except <em>ib</em>, which signifies life to beings, as in glib <em>liquid</em>, and bib to <em>drink</em>; for ab, eb, ob, ub, signifying from or out of life, would be improper to express life to things, as descending upon, and penetrating them, so as to give them motion, growth, generation, and sensation. Nor is there any adjective terminating in the letter p, it being expressive only of the parts of matter, as divisor of a, e, o, and t.</p>
<p>Ac, ec, ic, oc, uc, and their softer inflections, are expressive of the different modes of motion, as local, generative, and energic actions and their contraries, as in, weak, <em>our action</em>, black, <em>shut from the light</em>, slack and lag, <em>a low or earthly action</em>, meek, <em>a feminine action</em>, epic, <em>an action past</em>, like <em>the first action of light</em>, high, <em>man acting</em>, light, <em>its active property</em>, coasting, <em>acting along the edge or lower part of the possessions</em>, big, <em>a thing swoln with heat</em>, nigh, <em>acting in</em>, mock, <em>the motion of the cheek</em>, strong, <em>the property of the sun’s motion below</em>, much, <em>the upper parts</em>.</p>
<p>Ad, ed, id, od, ud, signify an addition and division of qualities emanating on men, animals, and substances of earth and water, as in bad, <em>an earthly life</em>, broad, <em>an addition of country</em>, dead, <em>matter without the addition of quality</em>, sad, <em>a low addition or quality</em>, glad, <em>that of being high</em>, mad, <em>the addition of being dumb</em>, or, <em>a brute</em>, red, <em>a diminution of the  colour of light</em>, aged, <em>a past or diminished action</em>, cold, <em>the passive quality of being deprived of the sun’s action</em>, blind, <em>deprived of animal light</em>, mid, <em>dividing the center of existence</em>, insipid, <em>a thing deprived of the internal taste</em>, arid, <em>the earth deprived</em>, calid, <em>deprived of a covering from the heat</em>, tid, <em>property diminished</em>, acid, <em>deprived of action</em>, acrid, <em>depraved action of fire</em>, wild, <em>deprived of volition</em>, odd, <em>deprived of or out of the circle of possession</em>, ward, <em>the spring or the division of man and woman</em>, rude, <em>the privation of truth</em>, crude, <em>a rude action</em>.</p>
<p>Af, ef, if, uf, with the inflections ave and ive, affirm the various state and situation of men and things in life, as, deaf, <em>he is deprived of sense</em>, safe, <em>he is standing</em>, slavish, <em>he is low</em>, brave, <em>he is a warm or spirited being</em>, chief, <em>he is the first</em>, active, <em>it is the property of action</em>, dative, <em>he or it is giving to</em>, accusative, <em>it is acting at us</em>, abusive, <em>he is from us</em>, captive, <em>he is taken</em>, abortive, <em>he is from the border of possessions</em>, adjective, <em>it is cast to</em>, gruff, <em>he is an angry man</em>, bluff, <em>he is an hairy man</em>.</p>
<p>Al, el, il, ol, ul, express the qualities of earth and water, as to the parts of extension and place, the ilation of the sun’s light thereon, all extension and human intelligence, as in, actual, <em>upon or in the state of action</em>, aerial, <em>in the state of air</em>, adverbial, <em>in the state of an adverb</em>, real, <em>upon the return of matter</em>, usual, <em>upon the state of us</em>, genial, <em>in the state of generation</em>, bestial, <em>upon the property of the lower beings</em>, annual, <em>upon the return of the year</em>, able, <em>from hell</em>, or <em>being deprived of light</em>, ample, <em>an extensive place</em>, genteel, <em>the first race</em>, level, <em>the place of the female extension</em>, single, <em>acting in a place</em>, little, <em>an extension of the rays of light</em>, agile, <em>the acting light</em>, chill, <em>without light</em>, civil, <em>a race living together</em>, evil, <em>privation of light</em>, idle, <em>about a place</em>, oll or all, <em>a circle extended</em>, whole, <em>man’s place of action</em>, full, <em>man enlightened</em>, artful, <em>the light of man upon properties</em>, dull, <em>without human light</em>.</p>
<p>Am, im, om, um, are expressive of the different forms, modes, and existences of the circumambient bodies, as lame, <em>the mode of crawling</em>, warm, <em>man covered about</em>, dim, <em>without extension</em>, firm, <em>the fire about</em>, some, <em>the things seen and sounded</em>, dumb, <em>an earthly being</em>.</p>
<p>An, en, in, on, un, signify existences of earth, water, and motion in general, and of man, as, mean, <em>me in earth</em>, human, <em>an earthly one</em>, sane, <em>sound one</em>, profane, <em>from purity</em>, clean, <em>an action of light upon matter</em>, ashen, <em>the lower one</em>, oak being the higher, even, <em>springing</em>, serene, <em>the stars in</em>, divine, <em>God in</em>, supine, <em>the low and up in</em>, benign, <em>being in</em>, twain, <em>two in</em>, one or un, <em>the spring or man in</em>, alone, <em>in the  state of one</em>, none, <em>no one in</em>, boon, <em>the food one</em>, wrong, <em>a man from acting upright</em>, dun, <em>the daily one</em>, young, <em>the growing one</em>.</p>
<p>Ar, er, ir, or, ur, are properties of earth, water, fire, extension, and human nature, as in clear, <em>the action of light upon</em>, dear, <em>upon thee</em>, near, <em>the not upon</em>, bitter, <em>the biting water</em>, eager, <em>water from action</em>, tender, <em>thin water</em>, dire, <em>he is hot</em>, intire, <em>in possession</em>, sore, <em>from the lower</em>, future, <em>the man in embrio to be born</em>, pure, <em>a man’s part</em>, immature, <em>too soon at man</em>.</p>
<p>As, es, is, os, us, affirm the different qualities of mankind and things, as, base, <em>a low or earthy thing</em>, adverse, <em>a spring downwards</em>, diverse, <em>a divided spring</em>, worse, <em>a low man</em>, aguish, <em>it is from a spring</em>, apeish, <em>he is a son</em>, wise, <em>he is man</em>, actuose, <em>it is all active</em>, close, <em>it is all shut</em>, globose, <em>it is all round as a ball</em>, jocose, <em>it is all joy</em>, noise, <em>it is all nose</em>, as voice is all vocal, or the sound of the cheeks, upish, <em>he is up</em>, abstruse, <em>from our property</em>, astonish, <em>it is the tone of an ass or brutes</em>, babish, <em>that of a baby</em>, copious, <em>a copy of man</em>, ingenious, <em>internally generated in us</em>.</p>
<p>At, et, it, ot, ut, with their inflections and compounds signify property or in possession and existence, as, great, <em>the action of fire at or upon the possessions</em>, last, <em>upon the lowest possession</em>, agast, <em>acting upon the lowest possession</em>, past, <em>a thing in the lowest possession or existence</em>, vacant, <em>a thing without possession or property</em>, radiant, <em>a division of rays upon the possessions</em>, sweet and secret, <em>female properties</em>, absent, <em>without possession or property</em>, agent, <em>acting in possession</em>, fit, <em>it is property</em>, apt, <em>a proper thing</em>, first, <em>the fire of life to the lower possessions</em>, instinct, <em>in action within</em>, white, <em>the upper property</em>, or <em>the firmament</em>, hot, <em>the action of the sun on things</em>, absorpt, <em>without a part of the circle of possession</em>, both, <em>man and woman</em>, moist and most, <em>things on the ground</em>, abrupt, <em>from the earth up into the possessions</em>, just, <em>the property of mankind</em>, curst, <em>a man’s action of the lower property</em>, occult, <em>actions without the property of light</em>, ancient, <em>one first in possession</em>, decent, <em>fair in possession</em>, acute, <em>a springing property</em>.</p>
<p>Y, ly, ty, thy, are expressive of properties, existences, and qualities generally, as in, any <em>the one in action or possession</em>, many, <em>the more in action or possession</em>, dry, <em>the thing without water</em>, airy, <em>the air</em>, ashy, <em>the ash</em>, barrenly, <em>the barren race</em>, brotherly, <em>the brother race</em>, happy, <em>the hap</em>, holy, <em>the high all</em>, sappy, <em>the sap</em>, forty, <em>the four tyes, times, rounds or tens</em>, swarthy, <em>the men of lower property</em>, wry, <em>from upright</em>; and thus are definable all other English, Greek, Welsh, and Latin adjectives. These have been taken at random, and the Greek and Latin terminations of adjectives being all in as, es, eis, os, òs, oos,  ous, us, on, and er, are mere affirmatives, by the sight, sound, spring, and motion of things.</p>
<p>So that adjectives and participles are names, which imply assertions and attributes, as those of qualities, affections, and properties of substances and things generally; but making no compleat sense, nor determining any particular thing without being joined to another word as <em>a daring</em>, <em>a daring man</em>. In the English language they are not varied in respect to genders, numbers, cases, or otherwise, except as to the degrees of comparison.</p>
<p>The three degrees of comparison mentioned by grammarians, are the positive, comparative, and superlative; the positive is the state in which the name was originally put; the comparative is formed by adding <em>er</em>, a spring beyond the original state, to the quality, where they will agree in concord, as, deep, <em>deeper</em>, <em>deepest</em>, high, <em>higher</em>, <em>highest</em>, sweet, <em>sweeter</em>, <em>sweetest</em>; <em>est</em> signifying a spring beyond the limits of the possessions; forming the superlative degree; but where those syllables will not so agree with the names and in participles, as in <em>aerial</em>, <em>ingenious</em>, <em>copious</em>, <em>daring</em>, <em>loving</em>, <em>loved</em>, the comparative must be formed, by setting <em>more</em>, that is, mo-er a great spring, in apposition to the name; and the superlative by the addition of <em>most</em>, signifying a spring beyond the limits of the possessions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="of-prepositions">Of Prepositions</h3>
<p>A Preposition is a substantive part of speech set before other names, most commonly substantives, either in apposition, as, <em>before a noun</em>, or in composition, as, <em>preposition</em>, to denote the situation or place of action, or rest of the things, to which they are joined; at the same time implying their similar relations or kindred; and connecting the names of substances, as, <em>from</em> this book, <em>with</em> the pen of the writer; or <em>from thence</em>, it may be inferred that prepositions are of themselves significant of things. But the use of prepositions or the names of cases are best understood from the following explanation thereof.</p>
<p>It is observable that O is an universal expression for the circle of motion and extension; that i signifies a perpendicular line or man placed in its center; and that this line, with a traverse one, expressed by T or ⊥ and signifying mankind  and other beings and things as extended, and the properties of man denote the nominative case, or that in which they were first named; and all the other cases, as they happen upon, up or down, or to or from either of these lines, are distinguished as in the following example.</p>
<p><img src="images/prepositions.jpg" alt="A spatial diagram of prepositions"></p>
<p>These prepositions are definable as follows.</p>
<p>In, with, within, to, into, unto, at, towards. In, signifies man placed in the center of existences, as a middle  being, partaking of, and connecting matter with spirit; with is the spring of i into male and female, and T their possessions inflected; within is the same in the circle of possession: to is T-O, the property of motion from T to the circle of motion; into the same within the possessions; unto, at, and towards, the same towards man or the line of possession; afore, before, against, signify things or parts in and out of the borders of possession.</p>
<p>After, behind, since, according to. After is off T or the border of possession; behind is to be after man in possession; since, having been in possession; according to, agreeing together in acting; between, betwixt, among, amongst, for, from, about; for, the parts or things of the circle of possession; about and from the parts or things within the circle of possessions of men; between and betwixt, the line i dividing the possessions; among and amongst, the things about the circle of possession. Above, up, on, upon; above, the upper spring of the human sight; up, the spring part, on and upon the sky.</p>
<p>Under, below, beneath, down. Under, not sprung within or up the possessions; down, not sprung in; below, from being up; beneath, to be not in possession.</p>
<p>Out, of, from, out of, without. Out, from the possessions of men and things; of, the things within the borders; from, the surrounding parts therein; without, out of possession.</p>
<p>By, through, over, over and above, besides, beyond, except, until. By, the part; besides, below the part; beyond, by the upper covering; thro’, from the possessions; over, from the spring of sight; except, acting out of the possession part; until, during the spring or possession of light; the two last names serve also for conjunctions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conjunctions">CONJUNCTIONS.</h3>
<p>A Conjunction is an active part of speech, that connectively or disjunctively joins together words and sentences, as the names of actions, as prepositions do those of substances. They have been divided by grammarians into various sorts; tho’ the only significant distinction seems to be into copulatives, connectives, and disjunctives, as the two former sorts  absolutely connect and coalesce both the sentences and their meaning, or when the expression is only of mere local or inanimate motion, barely move on, connect, and continue the sentence or discourse, without any compatibility of meaning; and the latter sorts conditionally, exceptionably, or interrogatively do the same. Of the first class are, and or ond, <em>on in division or discourse</em>, but, <em>be it as or by man and things soon</em>, yet, <em>it is or springs</em>, also, <em>on so</em>, likewise, <em>the same way</em>, still, <em>light on things</em>, altho’, <em>upon to</em>, notwithstanding, <em>not opposing the former action</em>, however, <em>be the spring of action as it may</em>, nevertheless, <em>without any spring</em>, as, <em>the earth seen</em>, as well as, <em>its surface or under it out of sight</em>, for, <em>the part in the circle</em>, therefore, <em>the parts and spring within the circle</em>, wherefore, <em>the parts in which circle</em>, because, <em>by our own actions</em>, that, <em>towards possession</em>. And the disjunctives are the following; or, <em>the promiscuous things within the circle of possession</em>, either, <em>action or matter</em>, nor, <em>not the things promiscuously within the circle of possession</em>, neither, <em>no action or rest</em>, till or untill, <em>during the spring of light on the possessions</em>, whilst or while, <em>the action of the upper light on the possessions</em>, if, <em>life or is it life?</em> unless, <em>my spring out</em>, except, <em>acting from the parts of possession</em>, besides, <em>by the side</em>; and with which sense the Welsh, Greek and Latin conjunctions correspond, as appears by an analysis thereof at the end of this essay.</p>
<p>An example of their use and construction.—Was it pride <em>and</em> folly, <em>or</em> avarice and envy, that caused the confusion of human speech? It was <em>neither</em> the one or the other, <em>but</em> the effect of some supernatural cause, <em>as</em>, the scripture informs us. <em>Nor</em> is it probable, that so great a deviation could have naturally happened; <em>unless</em> there was some very great wilful perversion of the original language, <em>whilst</em> mankind were contending for possessions <em>as well as</em> power. <em>Nevertheless</em> the first language is <em>still</em> recoverable, <em>notwithstanding</em> its many divisions and great disguise, <em>if</em> the subject be adverted, after a right method. And <em>altho’</em> it may be <em>also</em> attended with some labor to mankind, <em>except</em> those already skilled in languages, <em>yet</em> it may be attained by any English reader, that will endeavour it, <em>for</em>, <em>however</em> languages may differ, as to the manner of combination or construction of names and sentences, they are certainly one and the same in their principles, and <em>likewise</em> in their particles; <em>because</em> the letters and particles of all languages appear by this essay to be still the same. <em>Besides</em>, as human speech derives its origin from a supernatural cause, its various dialects cannot differ as to their materials. <em>Wherefore</em> then so many different opinions concerning these matters,  <em>but</em> from our own remissness? Let us <em>therefore</em> exert our faculties in the laudable undertaking of recovering the first universal language, <em>that</em> we may be thereby restored to our senses, which seem to be equally perverted.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="verbs">VERBS.</h3>
<p>Verbs are either simple or compound. The simple are those springs or energic signs in human speech, which, mark the relation and connection of the subject and attribute of a proposition; and affirm or deny the agreement or disagreement betwixt things, as, man <em>is</em> an animal. Compound or concrete verbs also include adjectives and participles; or the qualities and attributes of the subject of a proposition, as, man <em>thinks</em> or think is; sometimes only the subject, as <em>mae</em>, <em>eimi</em>, <em>I am</em>, or <em>sum</em>; and frequently the subject, affirmation and attribute, as, <em>walketh</em>, man is upon action. In some dialects verbs have been so modified, as to denote or imply the modes, times, persons, genders, and numbers of the things affirmed; and nominally distinguished, as verbs active, passive, neuter, personal, impersonal, regular, irregular, auxiliary, and substantive; tho’ according to their real use and signification, all verbs seem to be substantive and auxiliary, and either singly, or conjunctively, with adjectives or participles, formed into attributive or compound verbs, express all modes of actions and affirmations, as appears by the following instances; sum, I am, or, <em>it is man’s existence</em>, es, the second person created or the feminine gender, est, the second, first, and a third person born of the first and second, fui, <em>I have lived or been</em>, fuisti, <em>thou hast lived or been</em>, fuit, he the person born, hath lived or been; amo, I love or <em>am for a woman</em>, the first person, amas, the feminine the second person, amat, the third person produced, the third person, am-avi for ui in fui, <em>he has loved or been loved</em>, the past tense; doceo, I teach or <em>give the lowering action to man</em>, the first person, doc-es, the second person or feminine gender, doc-et the third proceeding from the other two, doc-ui, as in fui, I have lived or been taught, the past tense; lego I read or <em>recall</em>, the first person, leg-is the second, leg-it the third, and leg-i, <em>man read</em> the past; audio, I hear, or, <em>spring the passive sense</em>, au-di-is, au-di-it and au-di-vi, I have lived or been heard;  and the conjugating particles seem to be the degrees of comparison, as, a, e, i, or as, es is, male, female, mankind, or earth, water and fire, or motion and existences in general; and the persons of U <em>man</em>, and thence all things of the masculine gender the first person, as, es, or is signifying the feminine in different degrees and qualities, the second, and at, et, it, the rest of mankind and things, the third person, am-us, em-us, im-us, all men of the male kind of the first person plural, atis, etis, itis, all except the first person singular of the second, and ant, ent, int, all mankind and things in different degrees, except the first and second person singular, of the third person plural; and thus may be explained all the Latin and Greek modes of conjugating verbs.</p>
<p>Verbs are farther distinguished by grammarians into active, passive, and neuter, as being expressive of actions, passions, or neither the one or the other, but mere being or existing, as, <em>I love</em>, <em>am loved</em>, <em>live</em>, <em>walk</em>, <em>or stand</em>; tho’ according to the signification of words, there does not seem to be any real ground for the latter distinction, for <em>to love</em>, <em>to be loved</em>, <em>to live</em>, <em>sleep or rest</em>, must signify either actions, active passions and energies, or their privation and passiveness. So that the distinction in this respect might be more properly made into active and passive only, agreeable to the masculine and feminine, the only proper distinction of nouns as to genders; all actions, substances, and things, at least, as having relation to mankind, being either masculine or feminine, and the distinctions made by the Greeks and Romans being mostly arbitrary and contrary to the meaning of words which ought to determine the genders of nouns.</p>
<p>Verbs have a designation of person, corresponding with the personal pronouns; of number with the singular and plural of nouns, of tenses as representing present, past, and future actions and things; and of modes or the manner in which they ought to be expressed. But whatever necessity there may be for a great variety of modes and tenses in dialects, constructed upon arbitrary principles, it does not appear that any more than one is needful for a natural language, or that the modes of conjugating verbs or any other, are in fact expressible by human speech any otherwise than by the whole form or order of inflection and things. And tho’ present, past, and future, seem to be necessary expressions, according to our present mode of conception, yet they are not in reality any representation of time, but of our manner of dividing or reckoning the changes of motions or number of actions in extension, which in the eternal state of spirits, or  perhaps in a vacuum, might be deemed as one intire action or the present tense.</p>
<p>Simple verbs or affirmatives are all substantive and incapable of being inflected themselves, but serve as auxiliaries in the affirmations and inflections of compound verbs, tho’ alone, without the assistance of compound verbs sufficient to express every mode of affirmations, of actions and things, and fully correspond with the nouns and pronouns, as for instance, <em>I am doing</em>, <em>have done</em>, <em>may</em>, <em>can</em>, <em>will</em>, <em>shall</em>, <em>must</em>, or ought to do; thou, <em>art doing</em>, hast done, &c; he, she, a man, or, John <em>is doing</em>, <em>hath done</em>, <em>speaks</em>, <em>speaketh</em>, &amp;c. We <em>are</em> or <em>were doing</em>, <em>have done</em>, &c; besides, <em>id</em>, <em>ed</em>, with their inflections ith and eth, and also <em>is</em>, added as affirmations in the third person singular to compound verbs; which express attributes, affirmations, and persons, and sometimes the subject and number, tho’ the number is commonly implied by the noun or pronoun. In the following specimen of conjugating verbs, the persons, number, and actions or tenses are expressed by different words, with very few variations of terminations.</p>

<p>past.</p>
<p>The feminine or endearing inflections of the second persons <em>thou</em> and <em>ye</em> have been omitted, as needless, since they all agree with the pronouns <em>you</em> and <em>ye</em>, and the only changes are from are and be to <em>art</em> and <em>beest</em>, have to <em>hast</em>, were to <em>wert</em>, shall and will to <em>shalt</em> and <em>wilt</em>, and might to <em>mightest</em>, and do to <em>dost</em>; but to make use of them in the masculine gender, would be depreciating it. And the participle perfect, being superfluous, it has been likewise omitted; for as <em>ing</em> the present is compleat, so is <em>ed</em> for the past or the privative of springs or actions.</p>
<p>The signification of the conjugating verbs in the four languages is as follows, viz. 1. Am, mae, ειμι, sum, <em>in full form of existence</em>; be, fi, φυω, fio, <em>I live</em>; can, dichon, δυναμαι, possum, <em>in act</em> or able to act; may, amhay, ωμει, sim, <em>about acting</em>; would, could, should, might, ought, buasun, ειην, essem, <em>the will or act sprung or past</em>; shall, will, must, byddaf, εσομαι, ero, <em>the lower acting up, the spring of human light, the lower things sprung up</em>; was oeddun, ῆν, eram, <em>man or spring past</em>; have been, bum, ῆμην, fui, <em>acted in life</em>. 2. Are, ere, or art, beest, wit, or idwit, εις, es, <em>the lesser spring, and it is the spring of life</em>. 3. Is, it is, fi, id, idiu, εστι, est, <em>it is seen, sounded, smelt</em>, &c; hath, <em>it acts</em>; had or ha-ed, <em>action past</em>; hadst, <em>a female action past</em>; do or dost, <em>motion past</em>. 4. Are, ym, εσμην, sumus, <em>men in the spring</em>; were, buasom, εμεθα, eramus, <em>men sprung</em>. Let, bydd, εστο, esto, <em>extend</em> or take thy place; to be, bod, ειναι, esse, <em>the property of motion to beings</em>, which converts substantives into adjectives; ing, <em>in action</em>; it is not, nid, ουκ εστι, non est, <em>there is no motion</em>.</p>
<p>All English verbs which vary from this mode of inflection being erroneous and irregular, ought not to be established by grammatical rules, but restored to the primitive state in the present tense, and marked in the past tense with the proper accent; or if it should appear to be necessary, to add proper conjugations. But as verbs lose their qualities or active state in the past tense, the English verbs ending in d and t in the past tense, have been very properly diminished and substantived, and accordingly contracted in their sounds, of ed to that of d and t, as taught from teached, when the ch was accented hard, and a like the German a or o, felt for feeled, checkt for checked, slept for sleeped, left for leaved, gilt for gilded, bled for bleeded, fed for feeded, had for haed, fed for feeded, fled for flyed, sold for selled, and such others as are so contracted without any other variation, that are capable of a past tense, except, <em>let</em>, <em>put</em>, <em>do</em>, <em>think</em>, and other imperatives, which can form no perfect past tense, without the aid of the  auxiliary verb <em>have</em>, to express some degree of human energy or return to the creative fiat. And as all other tenses seem to be arbitrary and indefinite, the best way of expressing the minuter divisions of actions must be by adverbs or numerals.</p>
<p>And as there is no sort of foundation or necessity for the participle perfect, the best way of correcting those verbs which are supposed to be irregular therein, would be to drop it as superfluous, and fully as well expressed by the past tense, as help, helped, without holpen, cleave, cleaved, or cleft, instead of cleave, clave, clove and cloven, hang hanged, for hang hung. And as to the forming a regular past tense, by reducing irregular verbs to their primitive state in the present tense, the following may perhaps be no improper observation, viz. <em>all</em> in fall, before the corrupt sound of the northern a, as that of o, was, as it ought to be, accented, like <em>ale</em> in pale, and marked with a long accent, as signifying <em>from high</em>; its past tense accented short, as <em>all</em> in shall; and wrote <em>fall</em> and not fell; the e not having then taken the place of a, nor a, that of o; shake, signifying <em>a passionate action of a subject</em>, is properly accented and wrote in the present tense, but its past tense having partaken of the northern accent, it then came to be wrote and accented <em>shook</em>, instead of <em>shaked</em>, which, notwithstanding its long establishment by vulgar custom ought to be rectified accordingly; and so as to swear, heave, freeze, abide, strike, dig, and various other instances, where the e has assumed the place of a, a of o, o of a, e, i, or u, of i, or any other change of vowels from the present, to form the past tense; except such as <em>do</em> and <em>did</em>, which are different words, and of themselves incapable of any inflection. And the English terminations <em>an</em> and <em>en</em>, borrowed from the northern dialects, add nothing to the meaning of our names, but the English, or Engli-Saxon names, are of a southern or Celtic origin, and as fully expressive of the meaning to which they are applied without them; except where they are added to form the singular number, or to active names as substantiving articles, as in all other Celtic dialects.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="adverbs">ADVERBS.</h3>
<p>Adverbs are certain energic or active particles or <em>additional</em> verbs added to, or joined with other names in propositions, to denote the degrees and manner of things, as  to quantity, situation, quality, motion, and rest. Of quantity, as less, lesser, least, much, more, most, great, greater, greatest, long, longer, longest, short, shorter, shortest, broad, broader, broadest. Of situation or place, as where, whither? up, down, above, below, high, higher, highest, here, there, yonder, far, farther, farthest, within, without, upwards, downwards, forwards, backwards, and such as are expressive of the situation of bodies in motion, or at rest. Of qualities, as wisely, knowingly, sensibly, decently, likely, fairly, warmly, foolishly, beastly, coldly, hardly, and such as express intentional qualities. Of motion and rest; as comprehending affirmatives, interrogatives, interjectories, and those improperly called adverbs of time, as, when? now, anon, then, yesterday, to-day, to-morrow, henceforwards, ever, never, how often? often, oftener, oftenest, once, twice, thrice, seldom, however, away, begone, adieu, speedily, slowly, verily, yes, yea, no, why, however, perhap, alternately, as, alack, ha, alas, ho, oh.</p>
<p>There are no other sorts of adverbs, expressive of the order, time, or manner of things, as appears by the definition of those of the four languages in the vocabulary; nor does it thence appear that there is in fact above three sorts of adverbs, namely, quantity or extension or bulk of bodies; quality or an illation of light, heat and motion thereon, and penetrating the same, expressed by <em>ly</em>, as <em>ty</em> does extension in substantiving qualities; and motions energic, animate, and local, with the contraries, as privation, rest, and matter. And the degrees, like adjectives, are compared by adding <em>er</em> and <em>est</em>, as comparative and superlative, to the positive or the state or degree of beings and things in act, or putting <em>more</em> or <em>most</em> in apposition thereto.</p>
<p>The degrees of distance and situation, are reckoned like prepositions, upon lines, upright, across, or slantways, extended from the centre of action or existence in our system where man is supposed to stand; or upon man as a mikrocosm standing up with arms extended; his head representing the unseen celestial system, being the superlative degree upwards, the extent of his sight or the sky, the comparative, his body or the world, the positive, upwards, downwards, and crosswise, his limbs below the parts of generation, as representing the parts below the earth’s surface or growth part, the comparative downwards, and beyond it the superlative, the extent of view, the comparative sideways, and beyond it the superlative, as appears by the definition of Adverbs in the vocabulary. And tho’ interjections are supposed to add nothing  to the sentence, they certainly express the sorts and degrees of energy with which the whole is affirmed.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="syntax">SYNTAX.</h3>
<p>Having thus explained the several parts of a rational grammar, it now remains only to lay down some general rules for their construction, into simple and compound sentences, according to their natural concord, government, and arrangement.</p>
<p>All the parts of speech, which were originally only particles of one or two letters, having naturally coalesced and united, in more complex names, and words or propositions, without the assistance of art, so in all languages, like the English, in which respect both the simple and complex names still retain their primitive state, without any loss of their natural powers of construction, by any arbitrary addition or combination of artificial signs or modes of concord, like the Greek and Latin, the parts both simple and complex being precisely understood, will still be governed by their meaning, and naturally coincide in sentences, in the same manner as the ideas of a person unacquainted with the artificial rules of logick, are by their natural relation logically connected and formed into regular thesises, hypothesises and synthesises. As for instance; a person, who perfectly knows the meaning of the parts, can in his mind form and express the following sentences; two and two of any thing are, <em>is</em> or is to be sounded four, and not three; and should they happen to be horses, whether with or without shoes, they must be the horses of some man, rather than those of a cow; but if they are delivered, in whatever place they stand, it must be to and from some place, and by and to some body, or if they should only be called, it ought to be done by their right names. Or; supposing Adam, <em>i</em>, or any one know myself or himself to be the first man, inhabiting space, and that his length and breadth of extension, was at all times or upon all motions, and as much more, as he or i might by the extension of the arms acquire, without dispossessing another, were our own property, i might, as the first existence and proprietor here of the kind, call myself the first, one, or i. If I had a wife and a son, who had a wife and a son, and had been taught to tell seven in English, with their precise meaning,  I might as my next relation, as well as the second person in existence, name my wife two or thou, my son, as the third in being and possession, I might name he, him, or three, which make up the number of the singular stock; and as to the plural number or stock, the first and second person of the singular, and the son which sprung from them, with his son being four in number, and the first spring of the second stock might be named <em>we</em>, as the first person plural; the two wives <em>ye</em>, the second persons plural of the kind or genders; and all other persons excepting those of the singular number, as the grandson and his offspring, the sixth person from the first or the third in the second generation or plural number, <em>they</em>. Then if the first man or any other perfectly understood the meaning of all other names and energies, which appear to be as equally related to the nature of things as these, he could have no difficulty of putting them together according to true concord, as the meaning and signification would not permit him to err; nor indeed is the English to be taught by any other significant rules. The parts of speech being precisely understood, the best way then of acquiring the right English construction, is carefully to observe the manner and style of the best English writers, and to procure an habit thereof by reading and writing, rather than be perplexed by innumerable tedious and unmeaning rules of phrases, sentences, distinctions, and variations of names, from their natural order; for which there is no sort of foundation in the English, or any other language of nature.</p>
<p>But since the English language is that here proposed as an universal one, it may not however be improper to take some little farther notice of the rules of English Syntax. In all languages to form a right sentence the words must agree in construction with one another, as to case, number, gender, and person, either according to the natural order of things, or some arbitrary mode of concord and government, by a variation of the terminations substituted in lieu thereof in particular languages. But the English doth so only from the sense of the words, without any variation of terminations, except that es or s signifying the feminine gender, is sometimes added to form the plural number of substantives, and the substantive verb <em>is</em>, or the pronouns <em>it</em>, <em>with</em> its inflections, to form the third person singular of verbs, and as and es in some instances, to express the masculine and feminine genders.</p>
<p>And though it has no other case but the nominative, or any variation of cases at all, yet all English verbs agree with the substantives in number and person, without any exception;  and the state or situation of substantives are expressed by prepositions set in apposition thereto in the same manner as the articles; nor have the adjectives any variations, besides the degrees of comparison; and yet both they and participles agree with the substantives in gender, number and case; and when two substantives of different sorts of things come together, the place, state, or case of the last is expressed by the preposition <em>of</em> or-’s, signifying <em>of his</em>; unless the latter substantive is of the same sort with, or explains the former; in which case they are both of the same case, state, or situation. Conjunctions, adverbs, and relatives, serve to connect sentences, as prepositions do words. The relatives <em>who</em>, <em>what</em>, and <em>which</em>, and all other English names as well as things, must agree with the antecedents as their originals, whether persons, actions, or substantives. When two verbs come together, the latter is to be in the infinitive mode.</p>

<p>Some sketches of the creation, the original and present state of men and animals in our system of beings, the fall of man and other obscure scenes of antiquity, have been drawn from the sacred characters made use of by the Priests and Druids to preserve their original, ancient and secret knowledge, in order to illustrate the present subject, and setting the present confused, deluded, or enchanted state of language and knowledge in a right course and direction. But the press not admitting of their being exhibited in that order and mode, which seemed to be necessary for a compleat transmission of the sacred hieroglyfics, the following specimen must suffice for the present.</p>
<p><img src="images/hieroglyfics.jpg" alt="10 clusters of hieroglyphics, as described below"></p>
<p>The state of man previous to the formation of Eve and his essential modes. 2. His compound state or the nonessential modes and division into parts and actions. 3. Emblems of concupiscible appetites, innate parental traces, energies and passions acquired by the fall. 4. The state of man and woman after the fall, as enchanted and confined to place or matter. 5. The Serpent, an emblem of speech. 6. A theta instead of the Coptic kei, an emblem of man’s primitive state, &amp;c. 7. Birds; but the round U is made use for the Coptic e. 8. Beasts and Bulls. 9. Fishes. 10. Twigs and trees. But more of this hereafter.</p>
<p>And as all letters are thus deriveable from the parts of man, resembling all other things, Adam might be very well instructed, in their use in paradise;—And, the divisions of time appear to have been made from the days of the creation. See the former treatise.</p>
<p>O’er plants celestial, that fell below,</p>
<p>And grafs of <em>serf</em> which now together grow,</p>
<p>With her sword flaming round the living stem,</p>
<p>Guarding its fruit upon the side of Shem,</p>
<p>Expatiate free! ’tis the scene of man,</p>
<p>A mighty maze! beyond my present plan;</p>
<p>‘A wild where weeds and flowers promiscuous shoot;</p>
<p>Or garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>Together let us beat this ample field;</p>
<p>Try what the open, what the covert yield.’</p>
<p>Here to dispel prolific nature’s charm,</p>
<p>Prudence forbids; tho’ far from real harm;</p>
<p>And science shuns the Sympathetic touch;</p>
<p>So here we finish, lest we <em>feel</em> too much.</p>
<p>Withall affirming of the birth of tongue.</p>
<p>If _Hiero_’s right, others must be wrong.</p>
