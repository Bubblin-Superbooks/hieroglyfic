This, like all other original letters, has two sounds, the long and the short, as in <em>on</em>, <em>one</em>, <em>ton</em>, <em>tone</em>; and its shape or figure was taken from the circumference of the human pair close together, face to face, which is man’s chief circle place, signified by the term <em>world</em>. The Greek ω is a double υ as has been explained in my former treatise.</p></div> </div>
