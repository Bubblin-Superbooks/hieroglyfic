<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Of Nouns Adjective And Participle.</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Adjective and participle nouns are <em>added</em> to substantives and propositions, as expressive of the attributes or qualities, affections, and accidents of things, as in the following example; The <em>preying</em> beast was <em>daring</em>; the astonished guese are <em>fled</em>, <em>lost</em>, or <em>stolen</em>; and he is still <em>pursuing</em> a fled, lost, or stolen gus, in order to make a <em>sweet</em> morsel of its garbage; but all such sensations are <em>nauseous</em> to human nature. But qualities were originally expressed by the verbal actives, with few particles, and the compounded sorts were adjected thereto.</p></div> </div>
